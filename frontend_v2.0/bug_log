1) When you enter a new line in the textarea of a note in edit mode, it does not register as a new line, but a space.
    Exiting edit mode reveals the inconsistency.
2) Clicking on note "A" and then on note "B" does not result in entering edit mode for note "A", exiting edit mode for note "A",
    and entering edit mode in note "B".
3) The useState and useEffect hooks in frontend/App.js are causing an infinite loop 
4) Notes are delete from last to first. Only God knows why.
